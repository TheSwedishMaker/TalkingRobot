An Arduino Project with DFPlayer playing random audio files when a PIR sensor detects movement

This is a work in progress. Some issues still remain: 
 - It can play the same audio several times in a row 
 - ThereÂ´s a slight delay upon a second movement directly after the first one. 
 
 I am sure it can be made better but this is what I managed to make with it.
