An Arduino Project with DFPlayer playing random audio files when a PIR sensor detects movement

This is a work in progress. Some issues still remain: 
 - It can play the same audio several times in a row 
 - ThereÂ´s a slight delay upon a second movement directly after the first one. 
 
 I am sure it can be made better but this is what I managed to make with it. 

The audio files are stored on a micro sd card in a folder called mp3 and the files are named 0001.mp3, 0002.mp3 and so on.
